Angular SDKs
============

To support the creation of `spaces apps <https://kb.threatconnect.com/customer/en/portal/articles/2256255-spaces>`__, ThreatConnect has two SDKs for the `Angular framework <https://angular.io/>`__. Both of these SDKs are in early development and will undergo frequent changes when required.

spaces-ng

The `spaces-ng <https://github.com/ThreatConnect-Inc/spaces-ng>`__ package provides functionality for spaces apps. Documentation for spaces-ng is available `here <https://threatconnect-inc.github.io/spaces-ng/>`__.

threatconnect-ng
