Batch Commit
------------

As demonstrated by the code snippet below, the ThreatConnect Python SDK supports adding indicators in bulk to the ThreatConnect platform.

The code snippet below assumes that indicator data is formatted in the same way as the JSON `used by the API <https://docs.threatconnect.com/en/latest/rest_api/indicators/indicators.html#batch-indicator-input-file-format>`_ .

    ...

    # define the owner where you would like to put the data
    dst_owner = 'Example Community'

    dst_tc = ThreatConnect(api_access_id, api_secret_key, dst_owner, api_base_url)

    #
    # populate 'indicators' list of dictionaries as formatted here:
