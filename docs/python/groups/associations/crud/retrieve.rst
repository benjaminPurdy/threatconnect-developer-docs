Retrieve Group Associations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The code snippet below demonstrates how to view Groups, Indicators, and Victims which are associated with a given Group in ThreatConnect. This example is designed to retrieve the associations from an Incident with an ID of ``123456``. To test this code snippet, change the ``incident_id`` variable to the ID of an incident in your owner. This same process also applies to all group types. Simply change ``tc.incidents()`` to the group type you would like to retrieve. The available group types are: ``tc.<adversaries|campaigns|documents|emails|incidents|signatures|threats>()``.

.. note:: When the ``group_associations``, ``indicator_associations``, and ``victim_associations`` methods are called, an API request is invoked immediately.
