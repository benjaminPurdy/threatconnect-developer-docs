# Private Indicators

```eval_rst
.. warning:: In order to mark an Indicator as private, the ThreatConnect instance of ThreatConnect needs to have the ``privateIndicatorsEnabled`` configuration selected. This can be modified under System Settings.

.. note:: Custom Indicators cannot be marked as private. Only Address, Email Address, File, Host, and URL Indicators can be marked as private.
```

## Retrieving Private Indicators

When retrieving an Indicator, it is possible to see if the Indicator is private by appending the `includeAdditional=true` parameter to the query, as demonstrated below:

```
GET /v2/indicators/hosts/example.org?includeAdditional=true
```

JSON Response:

## Creating Private Indicators

To mark an Indicator as private when creating it, add the following key-value pair to the body of the POST query used to create the Indicator:

```
"privateFlag": "true"
```

For example, the following query will create a host Indicator that is marked as private:

```javascript
POST /v2/indicators/hosts
{
    "hostName": "example.org",
    "privateFlag": "true"
}
```
