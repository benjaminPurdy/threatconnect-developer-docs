Delete Indicators
-----------------

To delete an Indicator, the most basic format is:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/indicators/{indicatorType}/{indicator}

By way of example, the query below will delete the Email Address ``bad@example.com``:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/indicators/emailAddresses/bad@example.com

JSON Response:

.. code:: json

    {
        "apiCalls": 1,
        "resultCount": 0,
        "status": "Success"
    }

Viewing Recently Deleted Indicators
-----------------------------------

As of ThreatConnect version 5.4, it is possible to view a list of Indicators that have been recently deleted from an Owner. The general format for this request is as follows:

.. code::

    GET /v2/indicators/deleted

JSON Response:

.. code::

    {
      "status": "Success",
      "data": {
        "resultCount": 1,
        "indicator": [
          {
            "ownerName": "Example Org",
            "type": "File",
            "dateAdded": "2017-10-31T18:32:13Z",
            "lastModified": null,
            "summary": "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

By default, this will return all of the Indicators recently deleted in the API keyâ€™s default org. The number of days for which the Indicators will be listed on this API branch before being removed is specified by the ``indicatorDeleteRetentionTime`` system setting.

To view Indicators that have been recently deleted from a Community or Source that is not the default Owner, append the ``owner={ownerName}`` parameter to the query, as demonstrated below:

.. code::

    GET /v2/indicators/deleted?owner=Example%20Community

Delete Indicator Metadata
-------------------------

Delete Indicator Attributes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To delete an attribute from an Indicator, use the following format:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/indicators/{indicatorType}/{indicator}/attributes/{attributeId}

For example, if you wanted to delete the attribute with ID 54321 from the Email Address ``bad@example.com``, you would use the following query:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/indicators/emailAddresses/bad@example.com/attributes/54321

JSON Response:

.. code:: json

    {
      "apiCalls": 1,
      "resultCount": 0,
      "status": "Success"
    }

To delete a Security Label from an attribute, use the following format where ``{securityLabel}`` is replaced with the name of a Security Label that already exists in the owner:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/indicators/{indicatorType}/{indicator}/attributes/{attributeId}/securityLabels/{securityLabel}

For example, the query below will remove the ``TLP Amber`` Security Label from the attribute with ID 54321 on the Email Address ``bad@example.com``:

.. code::

    DELETE /v2/indicators/emailAddresses/bad@example.com/attributes/54321/securityLabels/TLP%20Amber
