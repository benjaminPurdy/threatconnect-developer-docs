# Delete Groups

To delete a Group, the most basic format is:

```
DELETE /v2/groups/{groupType}/{groupId}
```

The `{groupType}` can be any one of the available group types:

- `adversaries`
- `campaigns`
- `documents`
- `emails`
- `incidents`
- `signatures`
- `threats`
  
By way of example, the query below will delete the threat with the ID `12345`:

```
DELETE /v2/groups/threats/12345
```

JSON Response:

```javascript
{
    "apiCalls": 1,
    "resultCount": 0,
    "status": "Success"
}
```

# Delete Group Metadata

## Delete Group Attributes

To delete an attribute from a Group, use the following format:

```
DELETE /v2/groups/{groupType}/{groupId}/attributes/{attributeId}
```

For example, if you wanted to delete the attribute with ID `54321` from the threat with the ID `12345`, you would use the following query:

```
DELETE /v2/groups/threats/12345/attributes/54321
```

JSON Response:

```javascript
{
  "apiCalls": 1,
  "resultCount": 0,
  "status": "Success"

```

To delete a Security Label from an attribute, use the following format where `{securityLabel}` is replaced with the name of a Security Label that already exists in the owner:

```
DELETE /v2/groups/{groupType}/{groupId}/attributes/{attributeId}/securityLabels/{securityLabel}
```

For example, the query below will remove the `TLP Amber` Security Label from the attribute with ID `54321` on the Threat:

```
DELETE /v2/groups/threats/12345/attributes/54321/securityLabels/TLP%20Amber
