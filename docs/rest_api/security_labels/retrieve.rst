For example, the following query will return information about the ``TLP:Amber`` Security Label:

.. code::

    GET /v2/securityLabels/TLP:Amber

.. code:: json

    {
      "status": "Success",
      "data": {
        "securityLabel": {
          "name": "TLP:Amber",
          "description": "TLP:Amber information requires support to be effectively acted upon, yet carries risks to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organizations involved.",
          "dateAdded": "2017-07-13T17:50:17"
        }
      }
    }

Retrieve Items Labeled with Security Labels
--------------------------------------------

Retrieve Labeled Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view Groups labeled with a given Security Label, use a query in the following format:

.. code::

    GET /v2/securityLabels/{securityLabel}/groups

For example, the query below will retrieve all of the Groups labeled with the ``TLP:Amber`` Security Label:

.. code::

    GET /v2/securityLabels/TLP:Amber/groups

JSON Response:

.. code:: json

    {
      "status": "Success",
      "data": {
        "resultCount": 1,
        "group": [
          {
            "id": "54321",
            "name": "IOCs_report_2017.doc",
            "type": "Document",
            "ownerName": "Example Organization",
            "dateAdded": "2017-07-13T17:50:17",
            "webLink": "https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/document/document.xhtml?document=54321"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

You can also find associated Groups of a given type using the following format:

.. code::

    GET /v2/securityLabels/{securityLabel}/groups/{associatedGroupType}

Replace ``{associatedGroupType}`` with one of the following Group types:

.. include:: ../_includes/group_types.rst

For example, we could use the following query to find all Incidents labeled with the ``TLP:Amber`` Security Label:

.. code::

    GET /v2/securityLabels/TLP:Amber/groups/incidents

We can also drill down even further by adding the ID of an associated Group to the end of the query such as:

.. code::

    GET /v2/securityLabels/TLP:Amber/groups/incidents/54321

Where ``54321`` is the ID of an Incident labeled with the ``TLP:Amber`` Security Label.

Retrieve Labeled Indicators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To view Indicators labeled with a given Security Label, use a query in the following format:

.. code::

            "threatAssessRating": 3,
            "threatAssessConfidence": 50,
            "webLink": "https://app.threatconnect.com/auth/indicators/details/address.xhtml?address=0.0.0.0&owner=Example+Organization",
            "summary": "0.0.0.0"
          }
        ]
      }
    }

You can also find associated Indicators of a given type using the following format:

.. code::

    GET /v2/securityLabels/{securityLabel}/indicators/{associatedIndicatorType}

      "data": {
        "resultCount": 1,

          }
        ]
      }
    }

We can also drill down even further by adding the ID of an associated Task to the end of the query such as:
